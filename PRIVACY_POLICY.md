# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy applies to the following applications:

- HX Streamer Pro (sender)
- HX Streamer Receiver (receiver)

These apps are distributed as desktop software, including planned Microsoft Store distribution.

## 1. What We Collect

By default, we do not collect personal data on our servers.

The applications process the following data locally on your device:

- Connection settings you enter (IP, port, protocol, quality, FPS, UI theme)
- Video frames captured from your screen (sender app only)
- Video frames received over LAN (receiver app only)

## 2. How Data Is Used

Data is used only to provide core functionality:

- Sending screen frames over TCP/UDP in your LAN
- Receiving and previewing incoming frames
- Persisting local app settings for convenience

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.

Network transmission occurs only between devices you configure, using the IP/port you provide.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

Settings are stored locally on your device, for example:

- `%APPDATA%\\HX Streamer Pro\\config.json`
- `%APPDATA%\\HX Streamer Receiver\\config.json`

The apps do not upload these settings to external servers.

## 5. Permissions and Access

The apps may request or use:

- Network access (TCP/UDP) for LAN streaming
- Screen capture access on the sender app (required for streaming)

No account login is required.

## 6. Children

The apps are general-purpose utility tools and are not directed to children under 13.

## 7. Security

Data is processed locally where possible. If you use the apps on untrusted networks, you are responsible for network-level protections (for example firewall, VPN, segmentation).

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by changing the effective date.
